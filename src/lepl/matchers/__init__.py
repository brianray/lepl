Matchers form the basis of the library; they are used to define the grammar
and do the work of parsing the input.

A matcher is like a parser combinator - it takes a stream, matches content in
the stream, and returns a list of tokens and a new stream.  However, matchers
are also coroutines that can be "recalled" to return alternative matches.
This gives backtracking.

Matchers are defined and implemented as both classes and functions.  I have 
used the same syntax (capitalized names) for both to keep the API uniform.

For more background, please see the `manual <../index.html>`_.
