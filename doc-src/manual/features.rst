Features
========

Lepl combines the simplicity and ease--of--use of a recursive descent parser
with scalability (through memoisation) and advanced (but optional) features
like lexing, AST generation, offside--rule, robustness to ambiguous and
left--recursive grammars, etc.

* :ref:`Parsers are Python code <example>`, defined in Python itself.  No
  separate grammar is necessary.

* Friendly syntax using Python's :ref:`operators <operators>` allows grammars
  to be defined in a declarative style close to BNF.

* Optional, integrated :ref:`Lexer <lexer>` simplifies handling whitespace.

* Built-in :ref:`AST support <trees>` with support for iteration, traversal
  and re--writing.

* Generic, pure-Python approach supports parsing a wide variety of data
  including :ref:`binary data <binary>` (Python 3+ only).

* Well documented and extensible, modular design.

* :ref:`Unlimited recursion depth <trampolining>`.  The underlying algorithm
  is recursive descent, which can exhaust the stack for complex grammars and
  large data sets.  Lepl avoids this problem by using Python generators as
  coroutines.

* The parser can itself be :ref:`manipulated <rewriting>` by Python code.
  This gives unlimited opportunities for future expansion and optimisation.

* Support for :ref:`ambiguous grammars <backtracking>`.  A parser can return
  more than one result ("complete backtracking", "parse forests").

* Parsers can be made much more efficient with automatic :ref:`memoisation
  <memoisation>` ("packrat parsing").

* Memoisation can detect and control :ref:`left recursive grammars
  <left_recursion>`.  Together with Lepl's support for ambiguity this means
  that "any" grammar can be supported.

* Support for the ":ref:`offside rule <offside>`" (significant indentation
  levels) when using the lexer.

* Pluggable trace and resource management, including :ref:`deepest match
  <deepest_match>` diagnostics and the ability to :ref:`limit backtracking
  <resources>`.
