Contributions
-------------

For small bugs, please just explain the issue and I'll fix the code.

For larger contributions, please use the `mailing list
<http://groups.google.com/group/lepl>`_.  Any code / patches that are
submitted must include a "signing off" indicating that the author agrees with
the `Developer's Certificate of Origin
<http://elinux.org/Developer_Certificate_Of_Origin>`_ (as used by Linux) where
the licence is the LGPL as above.

I will keep contributions separate in the source, along with copyright notices
identifying the contributor.
