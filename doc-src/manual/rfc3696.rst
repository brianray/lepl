RFC 3696 - Email and URL Validation
===================================

`RFC 3696 <http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3696.html>`_ contains advice on how
best to validate email addresses, HTTP URLs, and "mailto" URLs.  I strongly
recommend that you read that document before using this library --- it will
help you better understand the motivation for these functions.  In particular,
they do not test whether arguments are *exactly compliant* with the
appropriate specificatons; nor do they guarantee any particular properties.

My interpretation of that document is that these are reasonable heuristics
that should help validate user input without causing too many false negatives.
That is all.

As such, the public interface exposes only three simple functions.  These are
factories that return a ``validator`` for each of the three types.

.. _validator:
.. function:: validator(value : string) -> bool
   :noindex:

   A function which, given a string, returns either ``True`` (in which case
   the value is consistent wth RFC 3696) or ``False`` (inconsistent).

The package *implementation* also contains various matchers for IP addresses,
etc.  The names of these functions are prefixed by an underscore, and there is
no gaurantee that they will remain stable between any revision of this
library.  Despite that, they may be useful as a reference, or to understand
better how Lepl can be used for validation.

.. module:: lepl.apps.rfc3696
   :synopsis: Validate email, HTTP and mailto URLs.
.. moduleauthor:: Andrew Cooke <andrew@acooke.org>

All (public) functions can be imported with::

  from lepl.apps.rfc3696 import *

They are *not* available directly in the `lepl <api/redirect.html#lepl>`_ package.

.. function:: Email() -> validator

   `Email() <api/redirect.html#lepl.apps.rfc3696.Email>`_: Generate a
   `validator` for email addresses.

.. function:: HttpUrl() -> validator

   `HttpUrl() <api/redirect.html#lepl.apps.rfc3696.HttpUrl>`_: Generate a
   `validator` for HTTP URLs.

.. function:: MailToUrl() -> validator

   `MailToUrl() <api/redirect.html#lepl.apps.rfc3696.MailToUrl>`_: Generate a
   `validator` for "mailto" URLs.

.. note::

   A warning like::

     No handlers could be found for logger "lepl.parser.trampoline"

  means that you do not have Python's logging configured.  If you are not
  using the logging package elsewhere then you can do the following to
  suppress the error::

     from logging import basicConfig, ERROR
     basicConfig(level=ERROR)
