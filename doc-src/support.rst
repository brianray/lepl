Documentation
-------------

You are currently reading the `Manual <http://www.acooke.org/lepl>`_.  The `API
Documentation <http://www.acooke.org/lepl/api>`_ is also available.

The simplest way to view the documentation is via the `web
<http://www.acooke.org/lepl>`_.  However, you can also install a local copy.
Simply download and unpack the appropriate files (see :ref:`download`).
