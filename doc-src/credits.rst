Tim Peters' `test_generators.py
<http://www.koders.com/python/fid9B99238B5452E1EDA851459C2F4B5FD19ECBAD17.aspx?s=mdef%3Amd5>`_
is to blame for starting me thinking about this, but it would have got nowhere
without Sam Wilmott's `Pattern Matching in Python
<http://www.wilmott.ca/python/patternmatching.html>`_, from which I have stolen
almost everything (including the repetition syntax).

`PyParsing <http://pyparsing.wikispaces.com/>`_ was also a major motivation
(if you don't like the way LEPL handles spaces, you may prefer Paul McGuire's
package which is, I think, pretty much the standard for simple, recursive
descent Python parsers).

Finally, thanks to `Guy Cousineau and Michel Mauny
<http://books.google.cl/books?hl=en&id=-vQPDXciXUMC&dq=cousineau+mauny>`_ for
the original education.
