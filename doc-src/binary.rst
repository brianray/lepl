Binary Data
===========

.. warning::

   The ``bin`` package is very new and still under active development.  The 
   API may change significantly (even between minor releases).  And the
   code is more likely to contain bugs than other parts of LEPL.

   This documentation is rather short and incomplete; it will be extended as
   the package is developed further.

The ``bin`` package supports parsing and (re-)construction of binary data.  It
uses the core LEPL engine which, because of Python's relaxed typing and
calling conventions, is not restricted to parsing text.  But it also adds
additional support to help address problems that are unique to handling binary
data.

The first few sections below discuss the representation of data.  This (rather
tedious) detail is necessary to precisely define how binary values are handled
by LEPL.

Abstract Model
--------------

LEPL models binary data as an array of bits, visualised from left to right.
The zeroth index is the least significant bit and is visualised as being
"leftmost".  For a value with `n` bits, the `n-1` index is the most
significant bit, visualised as being "rightmost".

In the API and documentation, `byte` refers to 8 bits (an octet).

Literal Representation
----------------------

Binary values can be expressed in a variety of ways.  Conversion from a
literal form to LEPL's internal model may require passing through an
intermediate byte-based form.  If so, LEPL preserves bit order within a byte
(ie the least significant bit of a Python ``byte`` corrresponds to the least
significant bit in LEPL's abstract model.  However, the `order` of bytes will
vary, depending on whether the encoding is little- or big-endian.

The following table summarises the representations support by LEPL:

+-----------+--------+----------------------------------------+-----------+

.. note::

   Big-endian encoded values must be a while number of bytes.  This is because
   the byte order must be reversed during translation to LEPL's internal
   model, and this process is undefined if the data do not completely define a
   series of bytes.

   In contrast, little-endian encoded data match LEPL's abstract model and
   so the value can be truncated directly at the given number of bits.

Lengths
-------

In various parts of the API it is necessary to specify the length of binary
data (eg. when matching).  If an integer value is given, it is taken as the
number of bits.  A float value, however, is taken as bytes, with the `decimal
portion as the number of bits`.  So, for example, ``3.4`` is equivalent to 28
bits (3x8+4).

BitString()
-----------

The ``BitString()`` class is an implementation of LEPL's abstract model
described above.  It has similar semantics to Python's strings, in that a
single entry (a bit - the equivalent of a character in a string) is still a
``BitString``::

  >>> from lepl.bin.bits import BitString
  >>> b = BitString.from_int('00110101b0')
  >>> str(b)
  '00110101b0/8'
  >>> type(b)
  <class 'lepl.bin.bits.BitString'>
  >>> str(b[0])
  '0b0/1'
  >>> type(b[0])
  <class 'lepl.bin.bits.BitString'>
  >>> str(b[1:4])
  '011b0/3'

  >>> s = 'abc'
  >>> type(s)
  <class 'str'>
  >>> s[0]
  'a'
  >>> type(s[0])
  <class 'str'>

The static method ``BitString.from_int()`` understands all the representations
described earlier.

Matching
--------

A ``BitString()`` can be passed to a LEPL matcher in the same way as a Python
string.  The matchers will "automatically" match and contruct the binary data.

The ``lepl.bin.matchers`` package defines some additional matchers to help
match literal binary values.  These include ``Const()`` for matching a
constant value, and ``BEnd(length)`` for matching a big-endian value of a
certain length (``LEnd(length)`` is similar for little-endian values).

The example below is rather details, but it shows ``Const()`` and ``BEnd()``
in use::

	  from lepl.bin.bits import BitString
	  from lepl.bin.encode import dispatch_table, simple_serialiser
	  from lepl.bin.literal import parse
	  from lepl.bin.matchers import BEnd, Const
	  from lepl.node import Node

	  # first, define some test data - we'll use a simple definition
	  # language, but you could also construct this directly in Python
	  # (Frame, Header etc are auto-generated subclasses of Node). 
	  mac = parse('''
  Frame(
    Header(
      preamble  = 0b10101010*7,
      start     = 0b10101011,
      destn     = 010203040506x0,
      source    = 0708090a0b0cx0,
      ethertype = 0800x0
    ),
    Data(1/8,2/8,3/8,4/8),
    CRC(234d0/4.)
  )
  ''')

	  # next, define a parser for the header structure
	  # this is mainly literal values, but we make the two addresses
	  # big-endian integers, which will be read from the data

	  # this looks very like "normal" lepl because it is - there's 
	  # nothing in lepl that forces the data being parsed to be text. 

	  preamble  = ~Const('0b10101010')[7]
	  start     = ~Const('0b10101011')
	  destn     = BEnd(6.0)                > 'destn'
	  source    = BEnd(6.0)                > 'source'
	  ethertype = ~Const('0800x0') 
	  header    = preamble & start & destn & source & ethertype > Node

	  # so, what do the test data look like?
	  print(mac)
  # Frame
  #  +- Header
  #  |   +- preamble BitString(b'\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa\xaa', 56, 0)
  #  |   +- start BitString(b'\xab', 8, 0)
  #  |   +- destn BitString(b'\x01\x02\x03\x04\x05\x06', 48, 0)
  #  |   +- source BitString(b'\x07\x08\t\n\x0b\x0c', 48, 0)
  #  |   `- ethertype BitString(b'\x08\x00', 16, 0)
  #  +- Data
  #  |   +- BitString(b'\x01', 8, 0)
  #  |   +- BitString(b'\x02', 8, 0)
  #  |   +- BitString(b'\x03', 8, 0)
  #  |   `- BitString(b'\x04', 8, 0)
  #  `- CRC
  #      `- BitString(b'\x00\x00\x00\xea', 32, 0)    

	  # we can serialize that to a BitString        
	  b = simple_serialiser(mac, dispatch_table())
	  assert str(b) == 'aaaaaaaaaaaaaaab123456789abc801234000eax0/240'

	  # and then we can parse it
	  p = header.parse(b)[0]
	  print(p)
  # Node
  #  +- destn Int(1108152157446,48)
  #  `- source Int(7731092785932,48)

	  # the destination address
	  assert hex(p.destn[0]) == '0x10203040506'

	  # the source address
	  assert hex(p.source[0]) == '0x708090a0b0c'

Binary Literals
---------------

The first part of the example above shows how a binary data structure
(``mac``) can be generated from a string representation.

Serialisation
-------------

The package also contains support for serialising data (``simple_serialiser``
in the example above).

Sized Integers
--------------

The results of the parsing are sized integers (``Int()``).  These include both
an integer value and a bit count.  They are subclasses of Python's ``int``
type and so can be used in normal code (length information is not proagated
through calculations).
